This program can be used to check Asterix category 02 and category 34 sector messages.
A simple visual dump is available to check for missing sector messages, north markers (EMM)
an calculates the rotation speed by displaying the delta time between two consecutive SMM0 messages.

This program was written in my own free time at home and is available to anyone who wishes
to use it within the limits of the license.
Always nice to hear if you use it, any feedback much appreciated.

Example
-------

For each received sector (SMM) message a X is displayed together with the
time of day value from the received SMM0, a N indicates reception of an EMM North Message
and the final column is the time difference between the current and previous SMM0 TOD.
The example below shows sector message 14 missing in the second rotation period:

X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X N 02:43:19.23 3.9609375

What is ASTERIX?
----------------

ASTERIX stands for All Purpose STructured Eurocontrol SuRveillance Information EXchange.

It is an ATM Surveillance Data Binary Messaging Format which allows transmission of
harmonised information between any surveillance and automation system.
ASTERIX defines the structure of the data to be exchanged over a communication medium,
from the encoding of every bit of information up to the organisation of the data within
a block of data - without any loss of information during the whole process.
ASTERIX is a EUROCONTROL Standard which refers to the Presentation and Application
layers (layers six and seven) as defined by the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
Reference Model (International Standards Organization (ISO) Standard 7498).

Transmission of ASTERIX coded surveillance information can make use of any available
communication medium, for instance Wide Area Network (WAN), Local Area Network (LAN),
Internet Protocols (IP), etc as those belong to lower layers. 

Considering that there is information common to all systems (for instance position,
Mode-A Code and Mode-C Code information), ASTERIX specifies minimum requirements
at the Application level, so as to ease data exchange between heterogeneous applications.
The communication between two different systems (even located in different countries)
is thus made possible, based on a core of commonly used surveillance related data,
transferred in the same way by the ASTERIX Presentation layer.
For the transmission of information related to a specific application, data items
are grouped in ASTERIX Categories. Up to 256 categories can be defined.
The definition of these categories and their composition is managed
by the ASTERIX Maintenance Group (AMG).
